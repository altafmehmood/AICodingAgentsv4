# Project Overview
- I am a full stack developer with a focus on backend development. I am using .NET 9.0 and Angular 20.
- I want to build a Breach Management System that will allow users to search for breaches and get a risk analysis.
- I want to use the Have I Been Pwned API to get the breach data and the Claude AI API to get the risk analysis. 
  - Have I Been Pwned API: https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3
  - Claude AI API: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
    - Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
    - Max Tokens: 1000
- I prefer to use the following nuget packages for the backend:
  - Flurl.Http: for http client
  - MediatR: for cqrs pattern
  - xUnit: for testing
  - NSubstitute: for mocking
  - Handlebars.Net: for html templating
  - PuppeteerSharp: for pdf generation
  - Microsoft.Extensions.Logging: for logging
- I prefer to use the default theme for the Angular 20 application, and follow all the best practices for the Angular 20 application.

# Git commit messages
- I want to use the following format for the git commit messages:
  - feat: add new feature
  - fix: fix bug
  - refactor: refactor code
  - test: add tests
  - chore: update dependencies
  - docs: update documentation
  - style: update styles
  - perf: improve performance
- I want the commit messages to be detailed and descriptive.
